# Supervised Learning Challenge
Module 21 Challenge: Supervised learning of credit risk classification data.

Graded __/100


## Report:
	This project applied machine learning to attempt to predict successful venture projects for investment. The funding applicant data analyzed is hypothetical as this project is to practice deep learning methods.

# (((IN-PROCESS)))
### Results:
- Machine Learning Model 1:
	Model 1 applied logistic regression on the dataset to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of 99.2%.
		Precision for a healthy loan was 1.00 and for high-risk loan was 0.85.
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was 0.99 and for high-risk loan was 0.99 (both weighted values)

- Machine Learning Model 2:
	Model 2 applied Logistic Regression with the "RandomOverSampler" module to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of 99.2%
		Precision for a healthy loan was 1.00 and for high-risk loan was 0.85
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was 0.99 and for high-risk loan was 0.99 (both weighted values)


# (((IN-PROCESS)))
### Summary:
	Both machine learning models resulted in similar prediction performance. Either method will produce accurate and precise results- whether or not the data was oversampled.
